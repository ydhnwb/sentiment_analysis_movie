"Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  ",Negative
"Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  ",Negative
Very little music or anything to speak of.  ,Negative
The best scene in the movie was when Gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head.  ,Positive
"The rest of the movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If it's about emptiness, it works I guess because it's empty.  ",Negative
Wasted two hours.  ,Negative

A bit predictable.  ,Negative

"This review is long overdue, since I consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be the single greatest film ever made.  ",Positive
"I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  ",Positive
"It's practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux ""masterpieces.  ",Positive
""" The structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema.  ",Positive
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute.  ,Positive
"In other words, the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films.  ",Positive
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  ,Positive
"It's quite simply the highest, most superlative form of cinema imaginable.  ",Positive
"Yes, this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle-solving, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture.  ",Positive
This short film certainly pulls no punches.  ,Positive
Graphics is far from the best part of the game.  ,Negative
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  ,Positive
It deserves strong love.  ,Positive
It is an insane game.  ,Positive

Today the graphics are crap.  ,Negative
"As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  ",Positive
This game rocks.  ,Positive
"Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  ",Positive
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  ,Positive
This was a flick doomed from its conception.  ,Negative
"The very idea of it was lame - take a minor character from a mediocre PG-13 film, and make a complete non-sequel while changing its tone to a PG-rated family movie.  ",Negative
I wasn't the least bit interested.  ,Negative
"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  ",Positive
But it's just not funny.  ,Positive
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  ,Negative
"His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  ",Negative
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  ,Negative
"The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  ",Negative
"But whatever it was that cost them so much, it didn't translate to quality, that's for sure.  ",Negative
"The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  ",Positive
"I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  ",Positive
"In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen.  ",Positive
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  ,Positive

"Excellent cast, story line, performances.  ",Positive
Totally believable.  ,Positive
Anne Heche was utterly convincing.  ,Positive
Sam Shepard's portrayal of a gung ho Marine was sobering.  ,Positive
I sat riveted to the TV screen.  ,Positive
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  ,Positive
I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  ,Positive
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  ,Positive
I was very disappointed in the movie.  ,Negative
One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard.  ,Negative
There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  ,Negative
There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  ,Negative
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  ,Negative
"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  ",Negative
"And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  ",Positive
"Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  ",Negative
"It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  ",Positive
There are some generally great things in it.  ,Positive
"I wouldn't say they're worth 2 hours of your time, though.  ",Negative
"The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  ",Negative

Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  ,Positive
"He is an amazing film artist, one of the most important whoever lived.  ",Positive

This if the first movie I've given a 10 to in years.  ,Positive
"If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  ",Positive
"Overall, the film is interesting and thought-provoking.  ",Positive

Give this one a look.  ,Positive
I gave it a 10  ,Positive
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  ,Positive
It is a true classic.  ,Positive
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  ,Positive
Definitely worth checking out.  ,Positive
The problem was the script.  ,Negative
It was horrendous.  ,Negative
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  ,Positive
The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  ,Negative
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  ,Positive
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  ,Positive
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  ,Positive
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  ,Positive
"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  ",Positive
I don't think you will be disappointed.  ,Negative
"Frankly, after Cotton club and Unfaithful, it was kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film, because it is BAD.  ",Negative

Too politically correct.  ,Negative
Very disappointing.  ,Negative

"I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie this lousy.  ",Negative
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  ,Negative
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  ,Positive
"The acting helps the writing along very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister could have been played better), and it is a real joy to watch.  ",Positive
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  ,Negative
"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  ",Negative
"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  ",Negative
The directing seems too pretentious.  ,Negative
"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  ",Negative
And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  ,Negative
"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  ",Negative
"Some applause should be given to the ""prelude"" however.  ",Positive
I really liked that.  ,Positive
A great film by a great director.  ,Positive
The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night.  ,Positive
The music in the film is really nice too.  ,Positive
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  ,Negative
Brilliant!  ,Positive
10-Oct,Positive
I liked this movie way too much.  ,Positive
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  ,Negative
It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  ,Negative
"However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  ",Negative
"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  ",Negative
There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  ,Negative
"This was a poor remake of ""My Best Friends Wedding"".  ",Negative
"All in all, a great disappointment.  ",Negative
"I cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this ""film"".  ",Negative
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  ,Negative
I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  ,Negative
"IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  ",Negative
"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  ",Negative
"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  ",Negative
"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  ",Negative
All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  ,Negative
"It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  ",Negative
"You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  ",Negative
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  ,Positive
"This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  ",Negative
The fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film.  ,Negative
"A truly, truly bad film.  ",Negative
"The acting is terrible, and the writing is worse.  ",Negative
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  ,Negative
I paid too much.  ,Negative

It was so BORING!  ,Negative
No plot whatsoever!  ,Negative
"Again, no plot at all.  ",Negative
Horrible!  ,Negative
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  ,Negative

"Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  ",Negative
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!!  ,Negative
"If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  ",Negative
Awful.  ,Negative
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  ,Negative
It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  ,Negative
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  ,Negative
"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  ",Negative
"Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  ",Negative
"Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  ",Positive
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  ,Positive
I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  ,Negative
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  ,Negative
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  ,Negative
I mean this in a terrible way.  ,Negative
This film has no redeeming features.  ,Negative
Everything is appalling.  ,Negative
"Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  ",Negative
The story is beyond stupid.  ,Negative
The script iswas there a script?  ,Negative
The kids are annoying.  ,Negative
The lead man is charisma-free.  ,Negative
"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  ",Negative
I'll even say it again  this is torture.  ,Negative
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  ,Negative
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  ,Negative
Highly unrecommended.  ,Negative
"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  ",Negative
"Yes, it's that bad.  ",Negative
Nothing at all to recommend.  ,Negative
An excellent performance from Ms.  ,Positive
"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  ",Positive
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  ,Positive
"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  ",Negative
There were too many close ups.  ,Negative
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  ,Negative
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  ,Negative
"""You'll love it!  ",Positive
This movie is BAD.  ,Negative
So bad.  ,Negative
The film is way too long.  ,Negative
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  ,Negative
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  ,Positive
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  ,Positive
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  ,Negative
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  ,Positive
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  ,Negative
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  ,Negative
"It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  ",Negative
"Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  ",Negative
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  ,Positive
His performance is simply genius.  ,Positive
"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire.  ",Positive
""" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  ",Positive
Ray Charles is legendary.  ,Positive
"Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  ",Positive
Hitchcock is a great director.  ,Positive
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  ,Negative
"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  ",Positive
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  ,Negative
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  ,Negative
"The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  ",Negative
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  ,Positive
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  ,Negative
"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  ",Negative
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  ,Negative
"And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  ",Negative
"He can bore you to pieces, and kill the momentum of a movie, quicker than anyone else.  ",Negative
"Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  ",Negative
"When I first watched this movie, in the 80s, I loved it.  ",Positive
"I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  ",Positive
"However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  ",Negative
"I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  ",Negative
The character developments also lacked in depth.  ,Negative
"Woa, talk about awful.  ",Negative
Do not waste your time.  ,Negative
It was just too horrible.  ,Negative
"The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  ",Negative
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  ,Negative
The poor actors.  ,Negative
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  ,Negative
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  ,Positive
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  ,Negative
"If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  ",Positive
"The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  ",Positive
"Regrettably, the film fails.  ",Negative
"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  ",Negative
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  ,Negative
"Yet, I enjoy watching it.  ",Positive
"Unfortunately, this is a bad movie that is just plain bad.  ",Negative
"Bad script, bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad!  ",Negative
The dialogue sucked.  ,Negative
The cinematography-if it can be called that-sucked.  ,Negative
The soundtrack sucked.  ,Negative
The acting sucked.  ,Negative
The concert sequences just sucked.  ,Negative
That was nice.  ,Positive
That was funny.  ,Positive
It was so funny.  ,Positive
"Overall, this movie was cheap trash.  ",Negative
"But this movie is not funny, considering the ridiculousness of it.  ",Negative
I came out of it feeling angry.  ,Negative
"***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  ",Positive
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  ,Positive
"Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  ",Positive
"And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  ",Positive
"All things considered, a job very well done.  ",Positive
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  ,Positive
"One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  ",Positive
"It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  ",Positive
"The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  ",Positive
"It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  ",Positive
Up there with the best of Melville.  ,Positive
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  ,Positive
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  ,Positive
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  ,Positive
"The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  ",Positive
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  ,Positive
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  ,Negative
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  ,Negative
There is a lot of beautiful places.  ,Positive
"It was forced, like everything in this movie.  ",Negative
"Again, lame.  ",Negative
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  ,Negative
And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  ,Negative
When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  ,Negative
Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  ,Negative
"The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  ",Negative
The acting was bad.  ,Negative
Really bad.  ,Negative
"Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  ",Negative
"Camerawork - again, bad.  ",Negative
Rating: 1 out of 10.  ,Negative
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  ,Positive
Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  ,Positive
"He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  ",Positive
"His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  ",Positive
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  ,Positive
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  ,Positive
"I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  ",Positive
"I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  ",Positive
"I recommend this for EVERYONE who loves film, movies, anything...A Work of Art!  ",Positive
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy.  ,Positive
I literally vomited while watching this film.  ,Negative
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  ,Positive
"his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  ",Positive
"the story which was told so eloquently by Francis ford Coppola 25 years earlier, really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop.  ",Positive
In a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast.  ,Positive
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  ,Positive
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  ,Negative
"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  ",Negative
"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  ",Negative
"One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  ",Positive
This is such a fun and funny movie.  ,Positive
Highly entertaining at all angles.  ,Positive
"It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  ",Positive
"So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  ",Positive
It even has its sweet moments.  ,Positive
The telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine.  ,Positive
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  ,Positive
And I really did find them funny.  ,Positive
This is actually a very smart movie.  ,Positive
There is a brilliant twist ending.  ,Positive
""" I love it.  ",Positive
"The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  ",Positive
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  ,Positive
I will never forget it now.  ,Positive
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  ,Positive
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  ,Negative
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  ,Negative
This movie is terrible.  ,Negative
"The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  ",Negative
"For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  ",Negative
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  ,Negative
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  ,Negative
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  ,Negative
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  ,Negative
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  ,Negative
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  ,Negative
Glad I didn't pay to see it.  ,Negative
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  ,Negative
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  ,Negative
It is a really good show to watch.  ,Positive
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  ,Positive
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  ,Positive
is pretty funny.  ,Positive
Babie Bop is very cute.  ,Positive
The kids are very cool too.  ,Positive
""" But ""Storm Trooper"" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  ",Negative
It's just lame.  ,Negative
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  ,Positive
Everything about this movie is stupid.  ,Negative
"Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  ",Negative
It is shameful.  ,Negative
I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  ,Positive
"The writers were ""smack on"" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  ",Positive
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  ,Positive
Now you know why I gave it a 10+!  ,Positive
"I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  ",Positive
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  ,Positive
The things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch.  ,Positive
This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  ,Positive
"Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  ",Negative
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  ,Positive
Definitely worth checking out.  ,Positive
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  ,Positive
This movie has a cutting edge to it.  ,Positive

I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  ,Negative
"It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  ",Negative
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  ,Negative
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  ,Negative
"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  ",Negative
"I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  ",Negative
"If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  ",Positive
"Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  ",Positive
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  ,Positive
"I really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cute.But if anyone has a question about Fort Steele, just ask away:)  ",Positive
This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  ,Negative
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  ,Negative

"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"".

"I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  ",Positive
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  ,Positive

Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  ,Negative

"Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  ",Negative
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  ,Positive

"The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  ",Negative
"The use of slow-motion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting (and bad is a kind word here), no continuity, scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever, vehicles that looked like they were made from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity.

"Oh yeah, and the storyline was pathetic too.  ",Negative
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  ,Negative

The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  ,Negative

"About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  ",Negative
The directing is sloppy at best.  ,Negative
"Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  ",Negative

STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  ,Positive
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  ,Positive
"While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  ",Positive
"However, after seeing the short again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how timeless the film actually is.  ",Positive
"It's just adorable seeing Mickey playing ""Turkey in the Straw"" in a highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way.  ",Positive
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  ,Positive
"The bipolarity of the ruthless thug (one minute a ruthless killer, the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial) is completely unconvincing.  ",Negative

"Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  ",Negative
The script is a big flawed mess.  ,Negative
The best example of how dumb the writing is when it's established that you can turn the zombie-students back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite.  ,Negative

"Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  ",Negative
"I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  ",Negative
"Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  ",Negative
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  ,Positive
"With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  ",Negative
The budget was evidently very limited.  ,Negative
"This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  ",Negative
"However, here there was no decent acting, action or location work to balance things up.  ",Negative
Filmiing was less expansive.  ,Negative
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  ,Negative

Not recommended.  ,Negative
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  ,Negative
There is no plot here to keep you going in the first place.  ,Negative

"Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  ",Positive
"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  ",Positive
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  ,Positive
"Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  ",Positive
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  ,Positive
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  ,Positive
"Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  ",Negative
"Her lines seem to have been WRITTEN by a fifteen year old, though they are trying oh so, so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really, um, you know, well... talk.  ",Negative
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  ,Positive
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  ,Negative
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  ,Negative
What is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles?  ,Negative
"To be honest with you, this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish.  ",Negative

My rating: just 3 out of 10.  ,Negative
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  ,Positive
"An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  ",Positive
Don't miss it.  ,Positive
"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  ",Positive
"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  ",Negative
"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  ",Positive
"It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  ",Positive
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  ,Negative
"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  ",Negative
Avoid at all costs.  ,Negative

"I know that Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull.  ",Negative
"He really didn't seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn't get involved with the guests.  ",Negative
"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  ",Positive
"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  ",Positive
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  ,Positive
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  ,Positive
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  ,Positive

"This movie is so mind-bendingly awful, it couldn't have even been created.  ",Negative
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  ,Negative
The least said about the acting the better.  ,Negative
This movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa.  ,Positive

"This is a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated by UPA's finest and thoroughly deserving of its Academy Award.  ",Positive
"Special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects, which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon.  ",Positive
"However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film ""about"" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  ",Positive
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  ,Positive

It is not good.  ,Positive

Then the film just dropped the ball.  ,Negative
This is a stunning movie.  ,Positive
Raw and sublimely moving.  ,Positive
"It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  ",Positive
All of the main players are mesmerising.  ,Positive
